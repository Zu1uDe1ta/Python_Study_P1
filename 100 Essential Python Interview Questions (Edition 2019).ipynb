    "### Q-1: What is Python, what are the benefits of using it, and what do you understand of PEP 8?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one of the most successful interpreted languages. When you write a Python script, it doesn’t need to get compiled before execution. Few other interpreted languages are PHP and Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamic-typed language. It means that you don’t need to mention the data type of variables during their declaration. It allows to set variables like var1=101 and var2 =” You are an engineer.” without any error.\n",
    "Python supports object orientated programming as you can define classes along with the composition and inheritance. It doesn’t use access specifiers like public or private).\n",
    "Functions in Python are like first-class objects. It suggests you can assign them to variables, return from other methods and pass as arguments.\n",
    "Developing using Python is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Luckily, Python enables to include the “C” language extensions so you can optimize your scripts.\n",
    "Python has several usages like web-based applications, test automation, data modeling, big data analytics and much more. Alternatively, you can utilize it as a “glue” layer to work with other languages.\n",
    "PEP 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 is the latest Python coding standard, a set of coding recommendations. It guides to deliver more readable Python code"
